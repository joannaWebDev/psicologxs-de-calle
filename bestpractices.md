# Best practice: 

- in React the css should have the same name as the component, so Pascal, meaning the first letter in uppercase 

- there should only be one h1 on each page (home). The exception here is that the logo itself is also a h1.

- the footer has at best, a h4 or h5, nothing of a higher level

- the naming of the classNames or id's should be explicit; .firstItem for example doesn't mean anything to anyone else besides the coder him/herself. And he may forget a week from now.-)

- if in your component's stylesheet you try to style a general h2 or a p or a div, remember it can affect the other components too. So is best to use css specification. 
for example .className h2
